Hi, all my games seem to be having some fps drop issue after I alt-tabbed into another app and then back into the game. It doesn't matter what game, all seems to be having the same issue. The first symptom I noticed is when I was playing Assassin's Creed Origins, the frame would drop from 60-ish to 45 after I opened my browser. When I checked the graphic settings, it seems to be changing the mode from Fullscreen to Borderless. If I switch back the display mode, the game will run normally again. I upgraded to a larger SSD drive. For some reason Windows Disk Management could not see the unallocated space on the new drive.
